    <br><br>
    <ul class="maroon" type="square">
        <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal- by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however,<span id="yellow"><b>in this tutorials we will use inline and internal styles</b></span>, because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="maroon">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="maroon" id="fontsize">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>
    <p class="maroon" ><i>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</i></p>
